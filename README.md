# Blackjack

Blackjack is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. It uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as Twenty-One. 

App based on Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. In this project I have learned:

* DOM,
* JavaScript for updating content and responding to events,
* Generating random numbers,
* Variable usage for tracking game state and values,
* Conditional statements for decision-making.
